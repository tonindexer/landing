Written in Go, Anton is an open source [The Open Network](https://ton.org) blockchain indexer available under the [Apache Licence 2.0](https://github.com/tonindexer/anton/blob/master/LICENSE). 
Anton is designed to provide a scalable and flexible solution for developers to access and analyze blockchain data.

Our indexer uses advanced algorithms to parse and process blockchain data, making it easy for developers to access and analyze large amounts of data in real-time. 
Our tool is designed to be extensible, so developers can easily add support for new TON smart-contracts.

By providing developers with an easy-to-use API to access and analyze blockchain data, 
we hope to accelerate the development of innovative new decentralised TON applications and the TON blockchain itself.
